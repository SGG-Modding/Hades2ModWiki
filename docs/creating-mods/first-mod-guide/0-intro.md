Start here to learn how to create and publish your first Hades II mod.

---

Before you start, please take a look at the [Development Environment](../development-environment.md) guide and ensure you have at least the minimum required setup.
Some parts of this guide will require some of the situational tools mentioned, this will be noted where applicable.

If you are already familiar with Hades II modding in general, you can skip ahead to a specific page in this section that interests you.
If you are new to modding Hades II, it is strongly recommended that you follow this guide in order, as each page builds on the knowledge from the previous ones, and you may miss important steps required to get your mod working otherwise.

:::warning[Thunderstore vs. Nexus Mods]
This guide, along with all other documentation in this wiki, is targeted towards mod publishing with [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/).
For Hades II, the modding community no longer uses Nexus Mods, you can learn more about why [in the FAQ](../../installing-mods/getting-started.md#why-move-away-from-modimporter-and-nexus-mods).

Once you're all set up, get started with the first part of the guide: [1. Using the Mod template](./1-mod-template.md).
